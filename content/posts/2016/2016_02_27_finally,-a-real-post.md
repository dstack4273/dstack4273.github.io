###My path to Pelican

_**Fair disclosure**_: this took me longer than most other Pelican powered blogs that I used for inspiration. There honestly wasn't much that was tricky overall, it was more that I like to have a pretty solid grasp of what I'm working on. Well, that and I wanted this to be something that I wouldn't be embarrassed if someone were to actually land here to read something that I write.

After what seemed like it would never end several times, I think that I have finally gotten this thing looking pretty nice. There are still some minor styling things that I would like to button up to call the ascetics "done", but truth be told they are so minor it isn't worth trying to cram learn Jinja, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap any more than what I already have.



###What the junk, why did this take you so long?!

I'm sure that for folks that have thought about setting up a web page or application in general the Pelican docs would get them to where they need to be for their blog.
