This is the first post on my blog, so I can check out how everything looks. I plan on eventually getting to where I regularly publish my notes here for things that I learn, figure out, or am stumped with as I work on learning how to code. For the time being though, this is still a work in progress as I figure out how pelican works, and get a workflow set up.
