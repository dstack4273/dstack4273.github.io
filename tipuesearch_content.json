Since virtually everything else that I have worked on to this point is for Python2, I hadn't really given any thought to the problem of how to continue to use VirtualEnv with a different version of Python. The topic is covered some in bits and pieces here and there, but no one really comes out and explains how to get it working. I do all of my work on OS X, so my configuration settings are from my .bash_profile dotfile. I have an existing Python 3 and Python 2 install through Homebrew. I had initially set up my VituralEnv Wrapper from the instructions listed in this tutorial . After that is working for you, all you should have to do is set up something like what I have in my .bash_profile: python3 = which python3 alias mkvirtualenv3 = mkvirtualenv -p $ python3 What this does is sets an environment variable that reads the location of your python3 install, and uses it along with the mkvirtualenv command's -p flag to define the version of python that you want to create your virtual environment with. You could just hard code in the path of your python3 install, but I thought that maybe using the actual python3 shell path might make it a little more robust to any changes I might make absentmindedly. Use Using this is super easy because of how I went about building it to work. Essentially those two lines allow me to have an alias that looks similar to the format of the python vs python3 commands. For a Python 2 project you can type mkvirtualenv <project name> and for a Python 3 project mkvirtualenv3 <project name> where <project name> is the name of your projectâ€¦(without the pointy brackets) and you'll have a new shiny virtual environment to start working in. Here are all of the things that I currently have in my .bash_profile if you are curious in what other witchcraft I've got gathered together: alias lls=\"ls \\-al\" alias mkvirtualenv3=\"mkvirtualenv -p $ py3 \" export PS1=\"\\[\\033[36m\\]\\u:\\[\\033[m\\]\\w\\[\\033[m\\] $ \" export CLICOLOR=1 export LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad # nvm export NVM_DIR=~/.nvm . $( brew --prefix nvm ) /nvm.sh # move usr/local to front of path export PATH=usr/local/bin: $ PATH WORKON_HOME=~/Envs source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh # ruby env mgr if which rbenv > /dev/null; then eval \" $( rbenv init - ) \"; fi py3= $( which python3 ) # adroid sdk export PATH=~/Library/Android/sdk/tools: $ PATH export PATH=~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools: $ PATH If you have any tips on how you work with both versions of Python in your environment please comment below.
